## Project Overview

Duple is a physical Model of a Quadropole Ion Trap. The goal of the project is to have an aesthetically pleasing (but still nerdy and cool) desk toy which has some pretty complex/interesting physics behind it. I chose walnut and brass because I think they are such a good combination of materials.  This project is purely for fun (although I am considering selling kits).  I am looking to learn more about circuit design, specifically USB-C design. As well as learning Manim. Wrapping my head around Manim is finally gave me a project interesting enough to sit down and learn some Python. This is my first project using both python/Manim & designing a full circuit with a MCU and USB-C. I like the ambitious stuff...

I go into detail on the mechanism of action (Math) and overal plan in the first video:

The second video contains more actual doing. I write the Code, do the CAD, and begin circuit design.

I like writing myself notes on when a project happened, and what I learned during it. Think of it like little breadcrumbs of learning. Or ignore them. Their for me, not for you... 
I started this project Mid January 2023 so far I have learned 
-Manim
-USB-C design
-ATtiny85 Design
